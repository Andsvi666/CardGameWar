# Cards War Game

Classic card game "War" remade as simple web game where player fights the computer.

## Description

This is a simple two-player card game. A standard deck of cards is divided evenly between the players. During each round, both players draw one card from the top of their decks and reveal it; the player with the higher card value wins the round. Only the numeric value of the card matters—suits do not affect card strength—and special cards are ranked according to predefined values. If both players draw cards of equal value, a “war” occurs: both players draw again, and the winner of the next encounter collects all cards involved, including those from the initial tie. This process can repeat if additional ties occur. When a player runs out of cards in their current deck, all previously won cards are shuffled to form a new deck. The game continues until one player has no cards remaining, at which point the other player wins.
